        //     black rectangle's left edge.  The larger value is the x-intersection.

        //   * Let's say the intersecting rectangle is #2.  How do we get the X value of intersection point i2?
        //     Look at the x value of the #2's origin.  Compare this to the origin of the black rectangle.  Once again,
